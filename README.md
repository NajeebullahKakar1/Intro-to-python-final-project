This project is a Library Management System built using Flask. It allows librarians and library members to manage books and borrowing activities. Users can add, edit, and search books, manage member accounts, check out and return books, and view borrowing history. The system uses Flask for the backend, SQLite for the database, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

Admin roles are preassigned in the usernames James1 and James2 (uppercase). If you sign in with these usernames, you will have admin access. 

We have one app file where all our backend code is stored. We made it like this so can easily run on any device. There is also a test folder where we tested the functionality of the sites.
